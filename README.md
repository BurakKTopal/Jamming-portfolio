# First React App inspired by the React-portfolio of CodeCademy
In this project I based myself on the <href a="https://www.codecademy.com/paths/build-web-apps-with-react/tracks/react-capstone/modules/jammming-capstone/kanban_projects/jammming-react18">React-portfolio</a> project 'jammming' by CodeCademy. The user is able to query for certain albums, artists or songs. 
Using the Spotify API, we fetch the corresponding tracks. The user can select the tracks he would like to add to his Spotify account.
