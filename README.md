# First React App inspired by <href a="https://www.codecademy.com/paths/build-web-apps-with-react/tracks/react-capstone/modules/jammming-capstone/kanban_projects/jammming-react18">React-portfolio</a> CodeCademy
In this project I based myself on the project 'jammming' by CodeCademy. The user is able to query for certain albums, artists or songs. 
Using the Spotify API, we fetch the corresponding tracks. The user can select the tracks he would like to add to his Spotify account.
